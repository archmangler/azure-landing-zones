# Bootstrap deployment and code for customer blueprints

* While customer application code should be completely decoupled from the Cloud Landing Zone infrastructure some management models require centralised control of customer applications from a deployment point of view.
* This folder contains the infrastructure blueprints for deploying customer application platforms to the landing zone
* It consists of a selection of generic blueprints for core applications used to support a hypothetical vending machine operations company
* NOTE: Automation consults the CMDB for the details of the instances of each application that should be deployed, how many instances and where (region, dc etc ...).
